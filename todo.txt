Exercises:
    Add user programs
        hd - use cat to make a test file to use with hd - easy
            Echo is ignoring multiple white spaces now...
            Clean up code for printint and printpad - can we combine both these to eliminate redundant code?
        pwd - is there a getpwd() syscall we can use? - working with directories 
        df - check how much space left on disk - checking disk drives
        date
        <check if other user programs are fully complete, and if not add to them>
        ...

    Add system calls
        creat - very similar to open
        lseek
        truncate(const char* path, int len) - truncate file at path to len
        <check if other system calls are complete, and if not add to them>
        ...

    Add functionality to OS
        Add signals
        Write driver (for some device QEMU can simulate)
        Port to x86_64
